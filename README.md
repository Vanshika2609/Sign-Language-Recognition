# Sign-Language-Recognition
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN's) is a popular machine learning approach and has been taken advantage of in the current research to ease the translation of Hindi text and speech to Indian Sign Language (ISL). Along with CNN the paper also contains Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and dense layers to increase the accuracy of the research. The system's ability to enable real-time translation of Hindi text and speech into ISL gestures, utilizing the CNN-LSTM-Dense architecture, holds great promise for promoting inclusivity and enhancing the quality of life for people who use sign language as their primary form of communication.

# Dataset Description
After reviewing several previous implementations and research literature, we found that there was no significant data available in the domain of Hindi sign language. Hence, all of the photos that were used to train and test the model were personally gathered. Images were captured by using a Samsung Smartphone camera which has a resolution of 48MP. Photos for 43 Hindi alphabets were taken from different angles to ensure the credibility of the created dataset. The captured images are depicted in the following figure.
